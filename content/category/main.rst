**LabMFA** members have been orienting their activities towards the
training of **human resources** and the development of **new knowledge**
that provide scientific and technological advances in the areas of
**fluid mechanics**, **aerodynamics**, **wind energy** and **atmospheric
sciences** and **computationa fluid dynamics - CFD**. The training of
human resources has been carried out at all levels, from undergrad
scientific research programs to graduate programs, with **master's**
and **doctoral** students, including **post-doctorate** researchers.
