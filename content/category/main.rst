The Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Aerodynamics (LabMFA) is one of
the oldest laboratories of DEM/PEM at Politécnica/COPPE – UFRJ. Over
approximately three decades of existence, LABMFA members have been
orienting their activities towards the training of human resources and
the development of new knowledge that provide scientific and
technological advances in the areas of fluid mechanics, aerodynamics,
wind energy and atmospheric sciences. The training of human resources
has been carried out at all levels, from scientific initiation programs,
with undergraduate students, to postgraduate programs, with master's and
doctoral students, including post-doctorate researchers.
