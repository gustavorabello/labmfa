With more than 30 years existence, Fluid Mechanics and Aerodynamics
Laboratory (**LabMFA**) is one of the most consolidated laboratory of
the Department of Mechanical Engineering with strong research activity
providing scientific and technological advances in the areas of fluid
mechanics, aerodynamics, wind energy and atmospheric sciences and
computational fluid dynamics (**CFD**). The working space comprises
3-floor laboratory including 300m2 of building area with large meeting
room for 12 seated attendees with 50'' TV and white board, 20-seat
lecture room with projector, 2 student offices with 12 desk capacity,
permanent staff room and full equipped atelier/machinery repair shop, in
addition to 200m2 of open space area comprising 2 **wind tunnels** with
balance and instrumentation for technical research and education.

LABMFA members have been orienting their activities towards the training
of human resources and the development of new knowledge that provide
scientific and technological advances in the areas of fluid mechanics,
aerodynamics, wind energy and atmospheric sciences. The training of
human resources has been carried out at all levels, from scientific
initiation programs, with undergraduate students, to postgraduate
programs, with master's and doctoral students, including post-doctorate
researchers.

The situation of the laboratory in view of the Center of Technology
(**CT**) located at Ilha do Fundao campus of the Federal University of
Rio de Janeiro is shown below. As can be seen, the **LabMFA** faces the
right side of the I building where all **Coppe** laboratories are
located,behind the C building. On the other hand, the Department of
Mechanical Engineering (**DEM/PEM**) is situated at the G building and
occupied the whole area. The route from LabMFA to the Department of
Mechanical Engineering takes 5 minutes on foot.
