Overview
========

The Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Aerodynamics (LabMFA) is one of
the oldest laboratories of DEM/PEM at Politécnica/COPPE – UFRJ,
therefore with a important traditional role in the university
construction. Over approximately three decades of existence, LABMFA
members have been orienting their activities towards the training of
human resources and the development of new knowledge that provide
scientific and technological advances in the areas of fluid mechanics
(comprising **one-** and **two-phase** flows), aerodynamics, wind energy
and atmospheric sciences. The training of human resources has been
carried out at all levels, from scientific initiation programs, with
undergraduate students, to postgraduate programs, with master's and
doctoral students.

Research Focus
==============

The laboratory has three main research areas are:

1. Two-Phase Flows
Research on two-phase flows is an active area of investigation, with
several future directions:

**Coupling Between Phases**: Understanding the interactions between 
phases in complex systems. **Interfacial Dynamics**: Studying the motion
of interfaces between phases. **Optimization Techniques**: Developing
new methods to optimize system performance in two-phase flows. Two-phase flows are a fascinating and complex phenomenon 
that has numerous applications across various industries. While they pose 
several challenges, experimental and numerical methods provide valuable 
insights into their behavior and optimization techniques can improve 
system performance.

2. Fluid-Structure Interactions

**Interaction between fluids and structures**: FSI simulations study 
the interaction between liquids, gases, and solids, predicting complex 
phenomena such as deformation and flow around complex objects. **Computational complexity**: FSI simulations require large computational resources due to the need to solve both fluid and structural equations simultaneously. **Applications in various fields**: FSI simulations have applications in aerospace engineering, biomedical engineering, and civil engineering, among others, enabling the design and optimization of complex systems.

3. Atmospheric Sciences

Investigating the Atmospheric Boundary Layer using turbulence models,
conservation equations, and numerical methods to better understand
weather patterns and climate dynamics. Analyzing data from weather
stations and other sources to identify trends and patterns in
atmospheric conditions.

4. Aerodynamics

Studying the behavior of fluids and gases in motion, with a focus on 
two-dimensional, incompressible flows around blunt bodies and aerodynamic 
bodies. Investigating the interaction between fluids and surfaces to improve 
wind tunnel designs.

5. Wind Energy

Analyzing wind data collected by anemometers to predict the wind 
potential of a region and optimize wind energy production.
Investigating new technologies and methods for increasing wind energy 
efficiency and reducing costs.

Methodologies
=============

LabMFA employs a range of cutting-edge methodologies, including:

1. Semi-Lagrangian Method

* A numerical method for simulating convective fluid flow with large time steps and **Reynolds** numbers
* unconditionally spatial-temporal stability

2. Moving Mesh

* Replacement for high computational cost refining algorithms 
* Works for several mesh elements such as quadrilaterals, triangles, tetrahedrons etc.

3. Discrete Vortex Method

* A numerical method for simulating fluid flow and turbulence.
* Used to analyze complex flows in aerodynamics and atmospheric sciences.

4. Wind Tunnel Experiments

* Used to test wind tunnel designs and optimize performance.
* Allows researchers to collect data on air flow and pressure around surfaces.

5. RAMS – Regional Atmospheric Modeling System

* A numerical model for simulating the behavior of the atmosphere. Used to analyze data from weather stations and other sources to understand climate dynamics.

In undergraduate research programs, undergraduate students actively
participate in all activities and usually work closely with a student or
group of graduate students. Graduate programs, in turn, are always
associated with scientific and technological research and development
activities, and the students involved come not only from UFRJ itself,
but also from other universities in Brazil and other countries in South
America. South.

Implications and Applications
=============================

LabMFA's research has significant implications for various engineering 
fields, such as:

1. Two-Phase Flows

* deformable interfaces
* front-tracking

2. Aeronautics

* Flow around blunt bodies
* Airfoil design
* Aircraft performance optimization

3. Naval Engineering

* Riser and offshore platform designs

4. Wind Energy

* Optimizing wind energy production
* Increasing efficiency and reducing costs

Training and Human Resources
============================

LabMFA provides training opportunities for researchers and students at
all levels, from undergraduate programs to postgraduate studies. The
laboratory fosters collaboration with experts from other universities in
Brazil and abroad, ensuring a diverse and dynamic research environment.

LabMFA also has a tradition of receiving recently graduated doctors and,
mainly, professors from other universities, including those from abroad.
In order to develop scientific and technological cooperation projects,
formal and informal agreements are maintained with renowned institutions
in the country and abroad. In the last decade, scientific cooperation
agreements were signed in the areas of fluid mechanics and aerodynamics
involving LABMFA and two renowned English universities, Imperial College
and the University of Bristol, in addition to an informal cooperation
with Yokohama National University, in Japan. In the area of
Wind Energy, a technological cooperation program between
LABMFA and the CDG – Carl Duisberg Gesellschaft e.V., a German
Foundation linked to the German Ministry of Economic Cooperation and
Development, ended recently. More recently, LAbMFA has established a
cooperation with the Petroleum Engineering Laboratory at the University
of Tulsa, OK, USA, in the area of two-phase flow in
pipelines.
