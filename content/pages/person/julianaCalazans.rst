I am a Mechanical Engineering graduated by the Federal University of Rio
de Janeiro (`UFRJ`_). I was a research scholar at the National Petroleum
Agency (`ANP`_), programming Finite Element Methods in `Python`_ from
2020 to 2022. Currently, I work at TechnipFMC (`TFMC`_), at Flexible
Technology Brazil setor, with R&D of flexible pipes. I am also a
master's student in Mechanical Engineering from the Mechanical
Engineering Program of the Alberto Luiz Coimbra Institute of Graduate
Studies and Research in Engineering, at the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro (`Coppe`_/`UFRJ`_). My areas of interest includes fluid
mechanics, computational fluid dynamics, multiphase flows, heat and mass
transfer, programming and, data analysis.
