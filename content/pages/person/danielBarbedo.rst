I have a strong interest in **numerical simulations** of both **fluid**
and **solid** mechanics. During my masterâ€™s studies, I developed a
mechanical contact formulation for solids using a **B-spline surface**
as the contact interface within a finite element simulation framework.
My doctoral research focused on **single-** and **two-phase flows**
simulations, employing the **finite element method** to model flow
through complex geometries, using a decoupled mesh approach for accurate
fluid interface representation. Currently, as a postdoctoral researcher,
I am working on **fluid-structure interaction**, using numerical
simulation to help design remotely powered intelligent materials.
