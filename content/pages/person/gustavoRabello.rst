My research field is numerical simulation on single- and two-phase
flows. During my doctoral studies, I'd been working on the
discretization of the fluid motion equations and the modelling of
intefacial forces through the Finite Element Method. The developed
in-house numerical code has been designed by modern and flexible
object-oriented languages: (`C++`_) and (`Python`_) which allowed easy
maintenance and further development. The Ph.D. thesis can be found here,
which was selected to be among the 5-10% best thesis written at EPFL in
2012 (more info). From Aug. 2012 to Aug. 2013 I worked as a Post-Doc
Associated in Nuclear Science & Engineering (`NSE`_) at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (`MIT`_) in Cambridge/Boston area.
The goal of the Post-Doc position was to benchmarking the
boiling/condensation experimental database using a commercial
front-capturing code available in the MIT group. In Sep. 2013 I have
finally returned to Brazil as Post-Doc assistant sponsored by the
Brazilian agency CAPES/Science Without Borders - Young Talent
Fellowship. In 2014 I become young professor at the Mechanical
Engineering at the State University of Rio de Janeiro (`UERJ`_). In 2019
I've started a professorship position at the Federal University of Rio
de Janeiro (`UFRJ`_). I'm member of the graduate school of Mechanical
Engineering at (`Coppe`_), Young Researcher of the State of Rio de
Janeiro (_FAPERJ) and currently awarded Royal Society-Newton Advanced
Fellowship (`more info`_).
