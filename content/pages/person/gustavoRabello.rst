My research field is numerical simulation on single- and two-phase
flows. During my doctoral studies, I'd been working on the
discretization of the fluid motion equations and the modelling of
intefacial forces through the Finite Element Method. The developed
in-house numerical code has been designed by modern and flexible
object-oriented languages: (C++) and (Python) which allowed easy
maintenance and further development. The Ph.D. thesis can be found here,
which was selected to be among the 5-10% best thesis written at EPFL in
2012 (more info). From Aug. 2012 to Aug. 2013 I worked as a Post-Doc
Associated in Nuclear Science & Engineering (NSE) at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge/Boston area. The goal of the
Post-Doc position was to benchmarking the boiling/condensation
experimental database using a commercial front-capturing code available
in the MIT group. In Sep. 2013 I have finally returned to Brazil as
Post-Doc assistent sponsored by the brazilian agency CAPES/Science
Without Borders - Young Talent Fellowship. In 2014 I become young
professor at the Mechanical Engineering at the State University of Rio
de Janeiro (UERJ). In 2019 I've started a professorship position at the
Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). I'm member of the graduate
school of Mechanical Engineering at (COPPE), Young Researcher of the
State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) and currently awarded Royal
Society-Newton Advanced Fellowship (more info).
