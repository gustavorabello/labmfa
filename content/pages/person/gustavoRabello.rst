My research focuses on developing **numerical simulations** for
**single-** and
**two-phase** flows, with applications in various fields such as mechanical
engineering, nuclear engineering, chemical processing, biomechanics, and
environmental science. Through my work, I aim to improve our
understanding of **complex fluid dynamics** and develop more accurate
predictive models. During my doctoral studies, I concentrated on
developing the discretization of fluid motion equations and modeling
**interfacial forces** using the **Finite Element Method**. I designed an
in-house numerical code utilizing modern and flexible object-oriented
languages: `C++`_ and `Python`_ to facilitate easy of maintenance and further
development. My Ph.D. thesis is available online [`link`_], which was
selected among the **top 5-10% best** theses written at `EPFL`_ in 2012.
From August 2012 to August 2013, I worked as a Postdoctoral Associate in
Nuclear Science & Engineering (`NSE`_) at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (`MIT`_) in Cambridge/Boston. The objective of this position
was to benchmark the **boiling/condensation** experimental database using a
commercial front-capturing code available within the MIT group. In
September 2013, I returned to Brazil as a Postdoctoral Fellow sponsored
by CAPES/Science Without Borders - Young Talent Fellowship. In 2014, I
became a young professor at the Mechanical Engineering Department of the
State University of Rio de Janeiro (`UERJ`_). Since 2019, I have held a
**professorship position** at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro
(`UFRJ`_). I am currently **head** of the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and
Aerodynamics (`LabMFA`_). Additionally, I'm affiliated with the Graduate
School of Mechanical Engineering at `COPPE`_, a Young Researcher of the
State of Rio de Janeiro (`FAPERJ`_), and a recipient of the Royal
Society-Newton Advanced Fellowship (`more info`_).
