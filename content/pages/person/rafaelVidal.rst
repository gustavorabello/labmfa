I am a Mechanical Engineer who holds a B.Sc. (2020) and an M.Sc. (2023) in
Mechanical Engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (`UFRJ`_).
My academic research focused on the numerical simulation of two-phase flows,
based on the Finite Element Method and on a semi-Lagrangian approach. My
professional background includes a 1-year experience in software development
and artificial intelligence applications for the oil and gas industry (2020),
as well as a 3-year experience in the aviation sector, working on the design of
lighting aids for air navigation (2020â€“2023). Since 2023, I have been working
as a Flexible Pipe Engineer at TechnipFMC, where I am responsible for the
analysis and design of flexible pipes for offshore oil and gas applications.
