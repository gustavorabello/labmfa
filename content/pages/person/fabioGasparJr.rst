I am a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at the Alberto Luiz Coimbra Institute for Graduate Studies and Research in Engineering (`Coppe`_) at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Catholic University of Petropolis (`UCP`_) in 2019 and earned my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (`PUC-Rio`_) in 2021. 
My doctoral research focuses on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the finite element method applied to biological systems, which analyzes blood flow dynamic and their behavior. As part of my work, I collaborated with the University of Glasgow (UK), where I spent six months advancing my research. My interest fields include two-phase flows, fluid-solid interactions, non-Newtonian fluid dynamics, blood flow behavior, and applications in biological systems.
