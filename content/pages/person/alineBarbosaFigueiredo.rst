I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate with emphasis on fluid mechanics
from the `Rio de Janeiro State University`_. Two-phase flow in pipelines
has been the my main research topic throughout my post graduate studies
at the `Federal University of Rio de Janeiro`_. First, during my
master's degree I have focused on studying mathematical models and
numerical methods to simulate two-phase flow in pipelines, through the
results of my research I acquired a vast understanding of the real
behaviour of fluids in pipelines. The results of my **PhD** and
**Post-Doc** research have lead the development of two simulators, one
to locate pipeline leaks in a **two-phase flow**, and a second to
**detect leaks** in pipelines, the later still in development.
