I am a D.SC. student in Mechanical Engineering from the Mechanical
Engineering Program of the Alberto Luiz Coimbra Institute of Graduate
Studies and Research in Engineering, at the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro. In 2018, I received my undergraduate degree in Mechanical
Engineering and in 2021 my master's from the Federal University of Rio
de Janeiro (`UFRJ`_), the latter  with a scholarship from the
Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel
(`CAPES`_). I started my research career during my exchange year at the
University of California at Berkeley, where I studied mechanical
properties of intervertebral disc in the `Berkeley Biomechanics Lab`_.
After finishing the undergraduate program, I worked with experimental
research in `NIDF`_ and, since 2020, I have been developing numerical
models for fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction in LabMFA.
