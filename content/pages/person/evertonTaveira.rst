I am a Master’s student in the Mechanical Engineering Program at
`COPPE`_, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (`UFRJ`_), which I
started in 2023 and have currently paused while completing the
Mechanical Equipment Engineering training program at `Petrobras`_. I
graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from UFRJ in 2022 and
hold a dual degree from École Nationale Supérieure d'Arts et Métiers
(`ENSAM`_) in Paris, with a focus on Fluid Engineering and Rotating
Machinery, achieved through the BRAFITEC program with a scholarship from
CAPES. During my studies, I interned at ORANO, where I worked on
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to optimize the geometry
of density meters for radioactive fluids. I have also worked as a
Research and Development Engineer at Michelin and as a Stress Analysis
Engineer at Eletronuclear. Currently, I work as a Mechanical Equipment
Engineer at `Petrobras`_, with interests in CFD, turbomachinery, and
rotating machinery.
