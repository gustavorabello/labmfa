He holds a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Federal University
of Rio de Janeiro (1984), a Master's in Mechanical Engineering from the
`Federal University of Rio de Janeiro`_ (1988) and a PhD in Mechanical
Engineering from Cornell University (1993). Full Professor at the
`Federal University of Rio de Janeiro`_, working in the Department of
Mechanical Engineering at Escola Polit√©cnica and in the Mechanical
Engineering Program at `COPPE`_. He is a senior fellow at the American
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), a senior fellow at the
Brazilian Association of Engineering and Mechanical Sciences (`ABCM`_)
and an individual associate member at the World Wind Energy Association
(WWEA). In Mechanical Engineering, his main area of expertise is Fluid
Mechanics, with emphasis on aerodynamics, wind energy, multiphase flow
in pipelines, and numerical methods (vortex method, panel method and
Eulerian numerical methods for hyperbolic equations).
