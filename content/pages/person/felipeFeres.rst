I am a Mechanical Engineer who graduated (2021) and completed a M.Sc. (2023) in
the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (`UFRJ`_). Both degrees were advisored
by `Prof. Gustavo R. Anjos`_. In my undergraduate final project, I carried out
a CFD study of a wind turbine using ANSYS CFX software. In my master's
dissertation, I developed a code to perform a CFD analysis of the performance
of a Diesel Particulate Filter, modeling the solid-fluid interaction as a
two-phase flow. Since 2023, I have been working at `PETROBRAS`_, where I also
completed a postgraduate specialization in Subsea Engineering. Currently, I am
involved in the implementation of subsea projects within the Oil & Gas sector.
