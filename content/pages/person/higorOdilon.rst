Mechanical engineer graduated from the Rio de Janeiro State University
(`UERJ`_) in 2015. He completed his master's degree in mechanical engineering
at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (`UFRJ`_) in 2025. Has interest in
heat transfer and computational fluid mechanics. In his master's
dissertation, he developed a numerical code to simulate a two-dimensional flow
in a control valve. This work used the finite element method as the numerical
method and the semi-Lagrangian method as the search algorithm. He currently
works at the National Center of Control and Logistics of Petrobras Transporte
S.A. (`Transpetro`_)
