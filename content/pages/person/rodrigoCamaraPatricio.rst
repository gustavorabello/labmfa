I am a Mechanical Engineer who completed an M.Sc. (2016) and a D.Sc.
(2024) in Mechanical Engineering at the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro (`UFRJ`_). My academic research focused on the numerical
simulation of pig motion in pipelines with single-phase and two-phase
flows. Between 2020 and 2024, I worked as an engineer at the Electric
Energy Research Center (`CEPEL`_) in the Mechatronics and Structural
Dynamics Laboratory, contributing to research and development projects
in the energy sector. Currently, I am a Pipe Design Engineer at NOV
Flexibles, where I work on the dimensioning and design of flexible pipes
for the oil and gas industry. Rodrigo Augusto Camara Patricio was a
M.Sc./D.Sc student at `UFRJ`_/`Coppe`_ under supervision of `Prof.
Gustavo Bodstein`_.
