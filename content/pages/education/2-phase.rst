[**COM-825**] 2-Phase Flows
___________________________

**D.Sc Level**: This course covers the fundamental principles and applications
of two-phase flow, which occurs when two distinct phases, typically liquid and
gas, coexist in a flow system. Students will learn to identify various
two-phase flow patterns commonly encountered in both industrial processes and
natural systems, such as bubbly, slug, annular, and stratified flows. The
course emphasizes the physical phenomena governing these flows, including phase
distribution, heat and mass transfer, and pressure drop. By the end of the
trimester, students will gain the ability to model two-phase flow problems
numerically using appropriate computational methods, enabling them to analyze
and solve real-world engineering challenges involving multi-phase systems.
