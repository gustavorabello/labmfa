[**EEK-597**] Computational Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer
_____________________________________________________________

**B.Sc. Level**: This course introduces the numerical modeling of fluid flow
and heat transfer phenomena using computational methods. Students learn to
formulate and discretize the governing equations of fluid dynamics and thermal
transport—continuity, Navier-Stokes, and energy equations—using techniques such
as the finite difference and finite element methods. Emphasis is placed on
algorithm development, stability and convergence analysis, and implementation
of boundary conditions. Applications include laminar flows, conduction,
convection, and coupled fluid-thermal systems. The course combines theoretical
foundations with hands-on programming and simulation practice, preparing
students to solve engineering problems using computational tools.
