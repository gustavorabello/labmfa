[**COM-774**] Mathematical Methods for Mechanical Engineering
_____________________________________________________________

**M.Sc./D.Sc Level**: This course provides a foundational understanding of essential mathematical tools used in mechanical engineering, with a focus on Differential Equations and Vector Spaces. Students will explore the formulation, classification, and solution techniques for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), including first-order and second-order linear systems, with applications to mechanical systems such as vibrations and heat conduction. The course also introduces vector spaces, linear independence, bases, and transformations, equipping students with the language and structure of linear algebra needed for the analysis of multivariable systems. Emphasis is placed on developing analytical skills and mathematical reasoning to support advanced topics in mechanics, control, and dynamics.
