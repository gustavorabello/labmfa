The courses listed below represent a selection of undergraduate and graduate
offerings made available on a regular basis throughout the academic calendar.
At COPPE, graduate-level courses are structured according to a quarterly
system, allowing for flexible academic planning across four terms per year.
Undergraduate courses, in contrast, follow a traditional semester-based
schedule. This structure ensures consistent availability of core and elective
subjects across all levels. Students are encouraged to consult the academic
calendar for specific enrollment periods and course offerings.
