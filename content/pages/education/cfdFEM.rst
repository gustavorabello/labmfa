[**COM-701**] Computational Fluid Dynamics: Finite Element Method
_________________________________________________________________

**M.Sc./D.Sc Level**: This advanced course provides a rigorous foundation in
the numerical modeling of fluid dynamics and heat transfer problems using the
Finite Element Method (FEM), with a focus on one- and two-dimensional
engineering applications. It covers the derivation of weak forms of the
governing equations, introduces Sobolev spaces such as L^2 and H^1, and
explores the mathematical structure behind FEM formulations. Emphasis is placed
on variational principles, stability, convergence, and the implementation of
boundary conditions for incompressible and convective flows. Students develop
the theoretical and computational skills necessary to construct and analyze
high-fidelity FEM solvers for fluid and thermal systems, preparing them for
research or advanced industrial applications.
