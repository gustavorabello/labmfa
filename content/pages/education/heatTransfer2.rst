[**EEK-501**] Heat Transfer 2
_____________________________

**B.Sc. Level**:  This course deepens the study of heat transfer with a focus on convection and two-phase flow. It begins with a review of differential operators (Gradient, Curl, Divergence, Laplacian, and Material Derivative) and energy equations in various forms (kinetic, general, enthalpy, entropy, and temperature), including key dimensionless numbers. Topics include natural convection, pool and flow boiling, film condensation (with Nusseltâ€™s analysis and empirical correlations), two-phase flow patterns in vertical and horizontal tubes, and pressure drop mechanisms in two-phase systems. Emphasis is placed on applying theoretical principles to practical thermal and energy systems involving phase change and complex fluid behavior.
