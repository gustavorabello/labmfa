     :comment: Numerical simulation of a light, deformable bubble rising under gravity in a sinusoidally modulated channel (width = 8.0, height = 0.5, amplitude = 0.07, wavelength = 2.0). The bubble (rho = 0.001, mu = 0.01) displaces a heavier, more viscous fluid (rho = 1.0, mu = 1.0) under gravity g = 9.81, with surface tension sigma = 0.01 and time step dt = 0.001. The curved geometry induces periodic confinement, modulating film thickness and causing variations in bubble speed and shape.  Simulation employs interface-tracking with ALE mesh motion to resolve complex deformations and wall-film interactions.

     :comment: Numerical flow simulation on a micro-channel section passed by a cylindrical pin, at a Reynolds Number equal to 209. The simulation was performed using an in-house code developed in Python language. The code used the Finite Element Method to discretize the streamfunction-vorticity equations to describe the flow. A passive scalar (in yellow) was inserted to assess the effects of the cylinder's wake on the flow's dispersion and mixture..

     :comment: This video shows a rising bubble test case with increasing sinusoidal wall effects. As can be seen, when wall is squeezing the bubble, its acceleration is much lower when compared to very large domains.

     :comment: Transversal cut of the converging channel simulation results displaying the bubble. In this simulation, the dimensionless channel diameter changes from d=2 to d=1 over a length of l=0.5. The bubble’s starting diameter is db= 1. The results of a converging channel simulation can be observed. It initiates with the bubble gradually adopting a mushroom shape as it advances toward the channel constriction. Upon reaching the constriction, the bubble undergoes a rapid change in shape.

     :comment: Transversal cut of the expanding channel simulation results displaying the bubble. In this simulation, the dimensionless channel diameter changes from d=1 to d=2 over a length of l=0.5. The bubble’s starting diameter is db=0.8. In this expanding channel simulation, initially, the bubble swiftly assumes the form of a Taylor bubble and advances towards the expansion section. As the bubble traverses the expansion, it swells, becomes curved, and then the lower portion of the bubble recedes, resulting in a bell-shaped configuration as it exits the channel expansion.

     :comment: This video shows the difficult modeling of the coalescence process using the interface tracking technique in quadrilateral meshes. As can be seen, after the initial coalescence of bubbles, the bubble flow speed increases dramatically and the bubble interfaces collapses. After this point, the numerical simulation is no longer valid.

     :comment: The simulation presented above describes the interection between fluid flowing between parallel plates and structure represented by a rectangular restriction. As can be seen, the fluid flow imposed a force to the structure that bounces until its steady shape. The von Mises stress is highlighted in colors shown on the top of the figure, while the horizontal velicity speed of the fluid flow is shown above.
