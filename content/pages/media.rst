     :comment: This video shows a rising bubble test case with increasing sinusoidal wall effects. As can be seen, when wall is squeezing the bubble, its acceleration is much lower when compared to very large domains.

     :comment: A CFD simulation was performed on a three-way ball valve at three different closing angles. The simulation utilized a Python code that applied the Navier-Stokes equations, solving the system using the Finite Element Method

     :comment: This video shows the difficult modeling of the coalescence process using the interface tracking technique in quadrilateral meshes. As can be seen, after the initial coalescence of bubbles, the bubble flow speed increases dramatically and the bubble interfaces collapses. After this point, the numerical simulation is no longer valid.

     :comment: The simulation presented above describes the interection between fluid flowing between parallel plates and structure represented by a rectangular restriction. As can be seen, the fluid flow imposed a force to the structure that bounces until its steady shape. The von Mises stress is highlighted in colors shown on the top of the figure, while the horizontal velicity speed of the fluid flow is shown above.
