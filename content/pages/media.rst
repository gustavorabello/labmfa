The following selection of videos and images are extracted from all
research documents produced in the **Fluid Mechanics and Aerodynamics
Laboratory - LabMFA**.

This video shows a rising bubble test case with increasing sinusoidal
wall effects. As can be seen, when wall is squeezing the bubble, its
acceleration is much lower when compared to very large domains.

This video shows the difficult modeling of the coalescence process using
the interface tracking technique in quadrilateral meshes. As can be
seen, after the initial coalescence of bubbles, the bubble flow speed
increases dramatically and the bubble interfaces collapses. After this
point, the numerical simulation is no longer valid.

The simulation presented above describes the interection between fluid
flowing between parallel plates and structure represented by a
rectangular restriction. As can be seen, the fluid flow imposed a force
to the structure that bounces until its steady shape. The von Mises
stress is highlighted in colors shown on the top of the figure, while
the horizontal velicity speed of the fluid flow is shown above.
